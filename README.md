# LuaTeX sample for Luaharfbuzz

This is a test of new text bindings of [Harfbuzz library to Lua](https://github.com/deepakjois/luaharfbuzz). The important file is `hb_test.lua`, where actual shapping is done.

## Installation

Install `Luaharfbuzz` using `Luarocks` and run `make`. It will generate correct paths for Lua module inclusion.
